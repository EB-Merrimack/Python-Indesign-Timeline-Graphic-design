# Timeline Visualization Project

## Overview
This project is a timeline-based visualization program that processes data stored in CSV format using Python. The program generates a structured visual representation of the data, which is further refined using graphic design principles and enhanced in Photoshop.

## Features
- **CSV Data Processing**: Reads and interprets structured timeline data from a CSV file.
- **Python-Based Visualization**: Uses Python libraries to generate an initial visualization.
- **Graphic Design Enhancements**: The visualization undergoes refinement using industry-standard graphic design principles.
- **Finalized Outputs**:
  - **300 DPI Poster (PDF Format)**: A high-resolution, print-ready timeline visualization.
  - **Mockup Tote Design**: A conceptual design featuring elements of the visualization applied to a tote bag.

## How to Use
1. **Run the Python Script**: Navigate to the `src` directory and execute the provided Python script to generate the base visualization.
2. **Edit Using Graphic Design Tools**: Open the generated image in Photoshop (or similar tools) to apply design refinements.
3. **Export Final Products**: Save the final visualization as a 300 DPI PDF poster and generate a tote bag mockup design.

## File Structure
- `src/` - Contains the Python script for generating the initial visualization.
- `data/` - Stores the input CSV file used for processing.
- `finalized_product/` - Contains the final high-resolution poster and tote design mockup.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Required Python libraries (refer to `requirements.txt`)
- Adobe Photoshop (or alternative graphic design software)
